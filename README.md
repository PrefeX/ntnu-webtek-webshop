# Adding a new template
* Create a folder in "public/products" with the name of your template.
* Make sure there is a file named "index.html" with the html of your template.

# Template guidelines
* The css file should be named "style.css" for consistency, but it's not required.
* Prepend "/" to a URL to access files within the root of public. Example: "/images/test.jpg"
* New: You may add as many html, script and other files as you want.
